At the top level, there will be an array of Quizzes
Each quiz has an id, title, description, whether it is published or not, and an array of Questions
Each Question has an id, body, questionType, array of options (for mc), expectedanswer, points, and whether it is published or not.
A questionType will have only two choices for now, multiple choice or short answer.

The top level will have to pass down functionality for all of the lower components to use.

How to handle total points?
When a question form is changed, check whether it made the question incorrect or correct. If it changed something, then increase or decrease a 
current point total handled by state.
